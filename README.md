# NatoAlphabetNameGenerator
The program takes in a string input and outputs the Nato Alphabet equivalent. This is a widely used radiotelephone spelling alphabet.
 This is to ensure that the names' spellings would be distinct enough to be easily understood by those who exchanged voice messages by radio or telephone,
 regardless of language differences or the quality of the connection.
